>I vote for the todo list application - we should stick to basic aspects of web development as it is not the main focus of the workshop.

>In the photo app we have to take into account downloading images, storing image data and issues related to preloading and presizing just to make the app not act like crap. These problems are next to non-existent in the todo app.

>As to the nice and catchy feeling- I think we should stick to a framework. My proposition is topcoat as it looks awesome. :)
