# Steps

1. Short introduction - each person, few sentences about experience and expectations.

3. Moderated discussion with client and gathering requirements.

  - Watching people and moderating.
    - These who use only technical language or only non-technical language should be cautioned.

# Artifacts

1. Each group will introduce own list of ideas before discussion panel with Client.

3. User story created for chosen requirement.
4. One *BDD-kind* automated UI test.
5. One unit test.
6. Updating broken BDD and Unit tests.

# Roles
