> As to creating a user story in different dialects- IMHO we should focus on one specifically in practice mainly due to time constraints. This of course does not stop us from including some information about the other ones in the presentation. I think it would be best to firstly introduce the dialect we're going to use in the workshop and then show how the other dialects map to it.
